              <h2>Background</h2>
              <p class="emphasis">
                As a Udemy user, I found aspects of the interface frustrating and uninspired.
              </p>
              <p>
                Udemy is a massive online learning platform that offers over 130,000 courses and reaches over 400 million students worldwide through their website and mobile app.
              </p>
              <p>
                I found Udemy’s interface clunky, visually unfocused and non-specific - more marketplace than learning platform.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Problem and Solution</h2>
              <p class="emphasis">
                How can I redesign elements of Udemy’s interface to create a student-focused experience that is stylishly minimalistic and distinctly educational in feel?
              </p>
              <h3>Solution</h3>
              <p>My redesign addresses four areas:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Minimalistic and decluttered navigation</li>
                <li>Streamlined course search</li>
                <li>Card design improvements</li>
                <li>Course progress status bar</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section id="process">
            <div>
              <h2>Pain points and competitive analysis</h2>
              <p class="emphasis">
                I found it hard to focus on the courses I was taking, because Udemy does not significantly customize the experience for a registered user.
              </p>
              <p>
                As someone who manages their ADHD, what most bugged me was the visual bloat. I found it hard to focus on the courses I was taking, because Udemy does not significantly customize the experience for a registered user.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through competitive analysis, I analyzed several other platforms, duplicating the pattern of interaction I knew from Udemy. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Competitive analysis provided the inspiration that led to my proposed redesign.

            <div>
              <h2>Redesign #1 - Navigation</h2>
              <p class="issue">
                The navigation bar is cluttered, unfocused and not personalized for students, the primary users. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The glut of links and suggested search filters results in a total lack of visual hierarchy.
              </p>
              <p class="improvement">
                The revised navigation is minimalistic and stylish, as it brings focus in UX writing to the student user.              
              </p>
              <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Integrated product category buttons, now found in the category menu</li>
                <li>Streamlined navigation, bringing focus to the student user experience</li>
                <li>Improved UX writing, education-oriented, rather than marketplace-generic</li>
                <li>Color for clarity and visual separation between discrete sections</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Redesign #2 - Category search</h2>
              <p class="issue">
                The existing category search is clunky and error-prone, as users must navigate across a wide screen area to access sub-levels of content.
              </p>
              <p class="improvement">
                My improved category search streamlines the user experience. The redesigned category menu is efficient, stylish and easier to use. 
              </p>
              <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Decreased likelihood of user error, by reducing the screen area covered</li>
                <li>More responsive user experience, as only user-selected content is displayed</li>
                <li>Fewer menu items displayed, reducing visual clutter</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Redesign #3 - Card design</h2>
              <p class="issue">
                The course cards in the progress bar are confusing, difficult to read and unstyled.
              </p>
              <p class="improvement">
                The redesigned course cards prioritize the display of overall course status, rather than progress in a single course video.
              </p>
              <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Clearly emphasized course title, disambiguated from lesson through text placement and styling</li>
                <li>Progress bar reflects overall course progress, more relevant than progress in a short lesson movie</li>
                <li>Attractive styling for contemporary look</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Redesign #4 - Course progress bar</h2>
              <p class="issue">
                The progress bar is confusing, because it is visually undifferentiated from the other content on the homepage.
              </p>
              <p class="improvement">
                The redesigned progress bar is stylish, motivating in tone and clearer at a glance.
              </p>
              <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Green horizontal bars break up white space and bring focus to the student's content</li>
                <li>The “My Learning” tab is upgraded to a more prominent ghost button</li>
                <li>Increased visibility of the course cover images is more visually appealing and improves readability</li>
                <li>Improved UX writing is friendly and more specifically motivating ("ready for your next lesson" vs. "let's start learning")</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2>Responsive design</h2>
              <p class="improvement">I also adapted the streamlined search functionality to the mobile app. The effect is a simplified and more efficient browsing experience.</p>
              <h3>Improvements</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Increased content visible above the fold [Search screen]</li>
                <li>Cookie-crumbs navigation improves user's ability to orient in a vast sea of results</li>
                <li>Increased content visible above the fold (by reducing ad size and increasing display of user-specific content) ["Featured" screen]</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </section>
          <section id="conclusion">
            <div>
              <h2>Result</h2>
              <p>
                Because of this case study, I had a motivating reason to make contact with a product designer at Udemy. We had a great chat about the UX industry, and we connected over Brazilian Portuguese (his native language, a passable L2 for me). He offered to meet me again when I was on the job search.
